  <h1>Relax...and Draw.</h1>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p> Relax, take deep breaths, forget your worries
    for a moment. Then, click and drag on the canvas to draw. Worry not about
    how perfect it is, just draw. Once you are done drawing, press 's' save it.
    To start over, press the 'e' key to clear your canvas.</p>

      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      This project is meant to be a way to ease our worries by drawing.
      What I suggest the user should do is make sure their posture is good,
      inhale deeply, and as they exhale, they draw a circle. Do not worry about
      how perfect it is. Let the hand guide you as you draw. Of course, the
      user doesn't have to just draw circles. They can draw other things too,
      like a mountain or a river.<br><br>

      This is a simple drawing machine that I made by playing around with the
      map and perlin noise codes until I got a line that closely resembles
      an ink stroke. I was inpired by the concept of ensō circles. The process
      of drawing a ensō circle is a meditative practice of letting go and
      letting your hand do the drawing. I made this drawing program as a way
      for us college students to relax and possibly reflect on this semester.
      The end of semester is fast approaching  and finals are coming up. For
      some of us, we are hanging on the edge of our seats, wondering whether
      we'll pass a class or not. I want to offer a way to take our minds off
      of those worries, even if it's just temporary.
