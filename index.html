For this project, I made a drawing machine that's  circles. The process of
drawing an ens≈ç circle is a a meditative practice of letting go and
letting your hand do the drawing. What I suggest the user should do
is make sure their posture is good, inhale deeply, and as they exhale,
they draw the circle. They simply draw while not worrying about how
perfect it is. Of course, the user doesn't have to just draw circles.
They can draw other things too, like a mountain or a river

I made this simple drawing machine as a way for us college students to relax
and possibly reflect on the semester. The end of semester is fast approaching
and finals are coming up. For some of us, we are hanging on the edge of our
seats, wondering whether we'll pass a class or not. I want to offer a way to
take our minds off of those worries, even if it's just temporary.
